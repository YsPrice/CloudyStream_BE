# CloudyStream_BE
Backend for CloudyStream Project
This is the code for my first portfolio project using MERN stack.
I learned a lot about working with REST API's through Node and Express. I also learned more about Database management and Schemas, as well as authentication tools like Firebase and JWT. 
App includes upload functionality, watching uploaded videos, saving videos to your list and deleting them. As well as querying.
Also had a lot of fun playing with styled-components for UI and conditional rendering.

Some of my main challenges involved initial rendering with Redux. Sometimes on the first render grabbing videos from the API returned null.
Firebase gave me some challenges as well, especially since the file uploading functionality was pretty new to me. 

If you want to run this app properly, I'd recommend making a db through mongo using the schema parameters, as well as set up your own firebase storage.
